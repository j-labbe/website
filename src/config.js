            'In 2015 I built my first computer and began teaching myself how to code. At first I used my coding skills to create plugins for a game I played with my friends, but as time went on, I began using it in personal projects.',
            'In 2017 I launched my first personal website as a way to highlight my resume. It has been developed and adapted over the years.',
            'In the beginning of 2021, I was offered work through various contracts, allowing me gain valuable professional experience in Full-Stack engineering & IT Consulting.',
            'Today, I am focused on completing contracted work as best as possible, and gaining experience at any tech company.',
            'As someone who is a self-taught and highly curious learner, I welcome any opportunity with wide-open arms.',
