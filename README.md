  This is my personal website. 
  I'll be updating it as I complete new projects and make any changes to the design and structure.

## 🤔 What would I have done differently in this project if I had more time?
I put this together in about 5 days. As previously mentioned, this is a basic version.
There are a few things that I didn't have time for before deploying this first version.

#### 1. Client Login
I frequently work with clients on projects. 
Having a project-tracking feature would be cool.

#### 2. Private Login
I have a few personal projects and services that would benefit from being hosted on the web.
