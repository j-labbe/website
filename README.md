  This is my personal website. 
  I'll be updating it as I complete new projects and make any changes to the design and structure.
</p>

## üõ† Installation & Setup
Install the Gatsby CLI (if not downloaded already)
```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```
Start the development server
```sh
yarn start
```

## üöÄ Production Version
Build a production version
```sh
yarn build
```

## ü§î Why did I use another project as inspiration?
I thought Brittany Chiang's design was fantastic. Using similar technologies as her, I built
this website while customizing it to meet my needs, and tweaking a few designs.

As time goes on, I will probably be changing the design to either my own or a [community design](https://www.figma.com/community/explore).
I needed to get a *basic* website up and running because I was in-between providers and loaded up with contracted projects.

## ü§î What would I have done differently in this project if I had more time?
I put this together in about 5 days. As previously mentioned, this is a basic version.
There are a few things that I didn't have time for before deploying this first version.

#### 1. Project Showcase
I will be using this site as a way to showcase different projects 
I work on. Ideally, I would be able to add new projects on the fly using a CMS.

#### 2. Client Login
I frequently work with clients on projects. 
Having a feature where they can login and see the stage of their project would be cool and appreciated.

#### 3. Private Login
I have a few personal projects and services I use that would benefit from being hosted on the web.
Implementing a private page just for myself would be a pretty cool edition and be useful for automating
a lot of my tasks at home.
